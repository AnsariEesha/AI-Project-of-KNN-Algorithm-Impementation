The whole code is in the file name AI_project.py
# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The project uses the dataset of iris.csv which we download from Kaggle. On this data we applied the k nearest neighbor(K-NN) algorithm to predict whether the particular parameters show the results as iris-versicolor, iris-setosa and iris-virginica . There are three classes on which we categorize our output.
